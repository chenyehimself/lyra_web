# Lyra

**Lyra is an early-stage AI hip-hop platform for cultural participation and expression.**

Hip-hop is one of the most globally shared languages of expression today.  
Lyra focuses on lowering the barrier to participation in this cultural ecosystem —  
not by replacing creativity, but by making expressive tools more accessible.

Inspired by the lyre, one of the earliest and simplest musical instruments,  
Lyra treats music as a medium for voice rather than a technical skill.

## What We’re Exploring
- Guided, conversational input as a path to musical expression  
- Hip-hop as a shared cultural space for participation  
- Systems that embed professional creative knowledge without requiring expertise

## Current Status
Lyra is in early development.  
We are building a functional demo and conducting user discovery.
